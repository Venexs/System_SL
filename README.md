# The System (Solo Levelling)
This is just a fun project I made, trying to emulate and fulfil the function that The 'System' in Solo Levelling had. (THIS IS JUST A TESTING VERSION!)

Context:

In the Anime/Manga/Light Novel, Solo Levelling, The MC has a screen only he can see that allows him to 'Level Up' his Physical Attributes such as, Strength, Agility, Vitality, Perception and Intellect. 

This Program is made to simulate that system by helping the user get motivation to work-out and gamify their life.

The GUI for this program is made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Tkinter-Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer/tree/master) 

## IMPORTANT 

When you open the program, after a while you'll see a tab called Penalty check. I'd suggest only adding game programs or etc. If any important exe that is required bt your system is added into the system, during penalty, your PC may crash and not open up again

If you don't want any risks, I suggest leaving the box empty 

This goes for everyone. This is still in Beta Test so please understand üôè

## Installation
